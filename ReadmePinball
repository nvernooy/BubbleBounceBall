a game almost kind of like pinball.
the player runs around collecting ball before they roll off the egde, getting bumped around by badguys in 
process.

the player gets 2 points for getting a ball, and when he reaches 5 points he can collect a bonus ball that
allows him to start shooting. a bonus ball is 3 points, and shooting a bad guy is 1 point.

highscores are saved in a textfile and the player can try to beat it.
the game ends when the player goes over the edge.

movement is via the mouse, leftclick is shooting. the further the mouse is from the player the faster he 
moves. spacebar is pause, escape is exit.

the game also displays sound effects for collisions, a scoreboard, and bad guys increasing as the score 
increases.

bugs: 	if the sound  clips are too many the sound stops playing
		the spacebar doesnt always pick up that it has been pressed
		the highscores wont save to the file
		sometimes the bad guys wont bounce of and stick to each other, or the player moves underneath a badguy
		when the final score is printed out it doesnt display lekker
		a limit is set to the number of badguys, but sometimes this is exceeded
