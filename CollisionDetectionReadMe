Readme of SuvivalGame with improved collision detection:


naive checks for collision is done in the collisions() method
these are checks that see if the object is already destroyed, as well as a spatial check whether the objects
are within a certian radius of each other.
once these checks are passed the collisionDetection() method is called

sprite bounding and pixel level tests are done in the collisionDetection() method
bounding boxes are checked to see if the intersect
next pixel level testing is done with the bitmasks of the objects textures
each pixel in the intersection area is compared relatively to the pixels in the bounding boxes
if both pixels are not transparent, eg a 1 one the bitmask, it is registered as a collision


futhermore some changes were made:
the intersection method used originally was replaced by the createIntersection method for rectangles
during initialisation collisions are checked between rocks so that it does not have to be done during gameplay
some redundant code was removed to streamline the program
